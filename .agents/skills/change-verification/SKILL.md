description: Use when checking a change works before calling it done — the smallest lint/type/unit slice for the diff, not the full gate. Covers check costs, the slice ladder, the docs guard and the commit gate.

# Verifying a change

**Verify the diff, not the repo.** `pnpm test` is lint + type + unit over everything, including
a full clippy and `cargo test`. A docs fix cannot break the crate, so running every test
checks nothing. While iterating, run the **slice** that could catch this diff breaking. The full
gate belongs to the lefthook pre-push hook and CI; a commit runs the **commit gate** below.

- Never re-run a check that passed if nothing it covers has changed.
- Never chain two heavy commands in one call. One that fails hides the cost of the other.
- Say in the report which slice ran (e.g. "fmt+clippy, cargo test package::version"). Never write
  "tests pass" for a slice.

## What each check costs

| check                                                   | catches                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vp fmt --check <files>` / `vp lint <files>`            | format, oxlint on TS, JSON, YAML, Markdown                                       |
| `pnpm -C rust check:lint`                               | rustfmt and clippy, default/node/python                                          |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --features node` / `python` | a binding, from `rust/`                                                          |
| `cargo test <name>` from `rust/`                        | the tests whose path contains the name                                           |
| `pnpm -C rust test:unit`                                | every Rust unit                                                                  |
| `pnpm -C typescript test:unit`                          | the loader's units and the Node conformance runner, which builds the addon first |
| `pnpm -C python test:unit`                              | the Python conformance runner; builds a wheel, needs `uv`                        |
| `vp test .scripts/-test/conformance.unit.ts`            | every conformance test file against its schema                                   |
| `vp test .scripts/-test/docs.unit.ts`                   | paths, scripts and skill tables in docs                                          |
| `pnpm build:docs`                                       | the real build over `rust/docs/`                                                 |

The first clippy or test run after a dependency change compiles for a minute; later ones take
seconds. The changed files come from `git diff --name-only main...` plus `git status --short`.

## The ladder

Pick the **highest** rung the diff reaches, and run everything that rung lists.

1. **Markdown, copy, a docs page.** `vp fmt --check` on Markdown files. For `AGENTS.md`,
   `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a skill, add the docs guard. For a page under `rust/docs/`, run
   `pnpm build:docs`: a page livemark cannot read fails there.
2. **Logic** — an action or a binding. `pnpm -C rust check:lint` and `cargo test` on the
   module. A new or changed test runs on its own first and fails before the fix. A binding
   change adds the clippy run for its feature.
3. **Build-shaped** — dependencies, a `Cargo.toml` under `rust/`, `rust/textlane/build.rs`, a `vite.config.ts`, a
   `tsconfig`, the bindings or the release scripts. Run `pnpm test`, then `pnpm build`; for
   the bindings, the local checks in **`package-distribution`**.

## Guards nothing selects

`.scripts/-test/docs.unit.ts` reads documents from disk and imports nothing. Run it by path
whenever the diff touches `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a skill, a renamed path or
a renamed script.

## The commit gate

A commit on `main`, and landing a worktree branch (**`worktree-workflow`**), run the **commit
gate** once, at the end: `pnpm check` always, then a unit half **you choose**.

- **`pnpm test:unit`** when the diff is build-shaped, touches `[features]` or a binding, or you
  are unsure.
- **Cherry-pick** otherwise: the `cargo test` filters the diff reaches, plus every guard above.
- The report names the path taken: "check + test:unit", or "check + cargo test package, docs guard".
