# Documentation

Keep every document true when the code changes, and put each fact where the next reader will
find it.

## Keeping the docs true

Run this **before committing**, once the work is done and the diff is final:

```sh
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git diff main...HEAD
git status --short
```

The guard in `.scripts/-test/docs.unit.ts` already fails on a path or `pnpm` command that no
longer exists. This is the other half: a paragraph that still parses, still points at real
files, and is no longer true.

- **A rename.** Grep the docs for the _old_ name — plugin, option, AST node, binding export,
  script, folder. The single most common miss.
- **A new or deleted command, script or source folder.** The command list and code structure in
  `AGENTS.md` and the tables in `CONTRIBUTING.md` enumerate them.
- **A changed default or contract.** An option's default, a node's shape, what a binding
  accepts or returns.
- **A removed mechanism.** Search the docs for the thing you deleted.

## Where to look

- `AGENTS.md` — the only one, at the repo root.
- the repo skills in `.agents/skills/` and the shipped ones in `.skills/`, including each
  `description`, which decides whether a skill gets picked up at all.
- `README.md`, `rust/README.md`, `typescript/README.md`, `python/README.md` — the three package
  READMEs share their usage section; change all three together.
- `rust/docs/` — the user manual, in Markdown with livemark frontmatter; a page should build
  cleanly with `pnpm build:docs`.

## Where a fact belongs

`AGENTS.md` loads into every session, so it carries only what must hold before anyone knows which
area they are in: hard rules, invariants that fail silently, terminology, one line per command
and per source folder, and the skills tables. Procedure, rationale and an area's traps go in that
area's skill. Keep `AGENTS.md` near 10 KB.

- How to **use** textlane (pipelines, plugins, the bindings) → the matching `rust/docs/` page
  and the shipped skill under `.skills/` covering it (`textlane-usage`), kept in step; each fact
  in exactly one.
- How to **work on** textlane → a repo skill in `.agents/skills/`.
- How a person contributes → `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Do not restate the change in the docs; the story is what `git log` is for. If the diff adds no
invariant and removes none, the right outcome is **no documentation change**.
